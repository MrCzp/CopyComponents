# CopyComponents
Copy all the component include values in HierarchyÔºÅ 

You can copy a prefab or gameobject in hierarchy ,and paste all the component in other gameobject.
Here, afford to *.cs, one of them is just copy the currrent level component ,and the other one is 
copy all the component include the subobjects's components.

You can download the folder,and copy to you project,then u will see the function under the GameObject.
