# CopyComponents
Copy all the component include values in Hierarchy 

You can copy a prefab or gameobject in hierarchy ,and paste all the component in other gameobject.
Here, afford to *.cs, one of them is just copy the currrent level component ,and the other one is 
copy all the component include the subobjects's components.

So ,any question just let me known.

Thanks.
